# Docker and Docker Compose Cheat Sheet

## Docker Commands

### Pulling Images

To pull the PostgreSQL Docker image, you can use the following command:

```sh
docker pull postgres
```

### Running Containers

To run a PostgreSQL Docker container, you can use the following command:

```sh
docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
```

## Running Containers in Detached Mode (`-d`) with Custom Names

Running Docker containers in detached mode (`-d`) allows them to operate in the background, separated from your terminal session. Combining this with the `--name` option provides a powerful way to manage and differentiate your containers.

For example, to launch a PostgreSQL container in detached mode with a specified custom name:

```sh
docker run --name my-postgres-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
```

### Using the `--name` Option in Docker Containers

When running Docker containers, the `--name` option allows you to specify a custom name for the container. This name serves as an identifier that makes managing and interacting with containers more intuitive and organized.

For instance, consider the following example where you're creating multiple PostgreSQL containers for different purposes:

```sh
docker run -d --name development-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword postgres
docker run -d --name production-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=supersecret postgres
```

## Checking Running Containers

After starting a container, you can use the following command to check all running containers:

```sh
docker ps
```

This command will provide a list of all the running containers, including their details such as Container ID, Image, Command, Created time, Status, Ports, and Names (if specified).

For example:

```sql
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS      NAMES
d088653c4e52   postgres   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   5432/tcp   my-postgres-container
```

This information is valuable for monitoring and managing your running Docker containers.

```

### Building Images

- Build an image: `docker build -t image_name:tag .`
- List images: `docker images`

### Managing Containers

- Run a container: `docker run -d --name container_name image_name:tag`
- List running containers: `docker ps`
- List all containers (including stopped ones): `docker ps -a`
- Stop a container: `docker stop container_name`
- Start a stopped container: `docker start container_name`
- Remove a container: `docker rm container_name`

### Working with Images and Containers

- Inspect a container or image: `docker inspect container_or_image_id`
- View logs of a container: `docker logs container_name`
- Enter a running container: `docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash`
- Copy files between host and container: `docker cp /path/to/file container_name:/path/in/container`

### Port Mapping

- Run a container with port mapping: `docker run -p host_port:container_port image_name:tag`
- Example: `docker run -p 8080:80 nginx`

### Removing Resources

- Remove an image: `docker rmi image_name:tag`
- Remove all stopped containers: `docker container prune`
- Remove all unused images: `docker image prune`
- Remove all unused volumes: `docker volume prune`

## Docker Compose Commands

### Basic Operations

- Start services defined in docker-compose.yml: `docker-compose up`
- Start services in detached mode: `docker-compose up -d`
- Stop services: `docker-compose down`

### Building and Running

- Build and start services: `docker-compose up --build`
- Build specific service: `docker-compose build service_name`
- Build and run specific service: `docker-compose up --build service_name`

### Managing Services

- List running services: `docker-compose ps`
- Execute a command in a running service: `docker-compose exec service_name command`
- View service logs: `docker-compose logs service_name`

### Scaling Services

- Scale a service to N replicas: `docker-compose up --scale service_name=N`

### Port Mapping

- Define port mapping in docker-compose.yml:
  ```yaml
  services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
  web:
    build: ./
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      uri :   "mongodb+srv://gaurang:khkhkhk@cluster0.ogtv1f4.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
    image: myflaskapp:1.0
